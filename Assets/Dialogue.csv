Hello! I am Roger! This is a test script. Lets see if this string is split correctly! I hope so; Because it would be a shame if not right? Lol//.0
Hi, I am Roger. While discovering Egypt, I dug up this ancient gauntlet. It appears to be from ancient mayan times. I want you to have it. It has some very special powers, but the only way to unlock them is through Game Progression, AHHH THE AGONY! Good luck. No, the gauntlet is not a turkey//.1
You made it past the tutorial. This was just a test simulation. Well done. Now, I am happy to provide you with your first power. Teleportation//!2
To Teleport, hold the SHIFT key and click within the radius to teleport there. It's power is limited, there will be a cooldown with each use. Now, test out your new ability to get past this wall//!3
Great job teleporting past that wall, you are a fast learner! These Ladders bring you to further stages! To use a ladder stand under the ladder and press W//.4
Use A and D to move around//.5
Press SPACEBAR to jump//.6
Enemies are looking for The Gauntlet. Try to avoid being seen. (it won't end well)//!7
Well Done//!8
