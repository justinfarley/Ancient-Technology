Hello! I am Roger! This is a test script. Lets see if this string is split correctly! I hope so; Because it would be a shame if not right? Lol//.0
I see you have stumbled down into the dark depths. I will be your friend throughout your journey, my name is Roger! My nephew found this ancient Gauntlet in our backyard. I want you to have it. It has some very special powers, but the only way to unlock them is through Game Progression. The Agony! Good luck. No it isn't a turkey//.1
You made it past the first level. This was just a test simulation. I was simply assuring myself that you are indeed the chosen one. Well done. I am happy to provide you with your first power. Teleportation//!2
To use your power hold the SHIFT key and click within the radius to teleport there. It's power is limited, there will be a cooldown with each use. Now test out your new ability to get past this wall//!3
